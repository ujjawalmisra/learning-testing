## Assignment-1

Given 2 matrices A, B write neat, clean, reusable functions to:
1. A+B
2. A-B
3. A*B
4. k * (any matrix) ----- where k is a scalar
5. A' ---- compute transpose of any matrix

Note: A, B can be any matrices. I should be able to specify any 2 new matrices and call your functions without the need
of changing anything else except the 2 matrices.

Note: Matrices will be 2-D, but the number of rows and cols can be dynamic.
